# Typology of Elements

**UXDL** offers unstyled primitives (some base styles needed for functional
purposes). Any default styles applied to the primitives are
basic structure or basic functionality controls to make the component useful
out of the box without further styling. All base styles are easily overrideble
and won't effect the functionality (but may affect accessibility).

UXDL Primitives provides the themeing capability with the default theme being
the P&G Coporate color scheme (via the property `variant="primary"`.

UXDL Primitives are not meant to be a fully-styled system like Bootstrap but
rather a set of building block components that can be used to achieve
functionality and accessibility while giving the controls of the style to
the developers.

## Components

At the core of **UXDL**, all the components should follow the
[Principles of UXDL](https://github.com/procter-gamble/uxdl-primitives#principles-of-uxdl) and 
should be also **customizable from global or scoped variables**.

Most popular components are `Button` or `Card`:

<Canvas>
  <Card.Root variant="primary">
    <Card.Media>
      <img src="https://pgone.sharepoint.com/sites/Uxpg/Shared%20Documents/UXDL/static/ui-components/7.2.jpg" />
    </Card.Media>
    <Card.Title>A Sample Card</Card.Title>
    <Card.Description>A sample card description that could attract a user to do something</Card.Description>
    <Card.CTA><Button variant="primary">A Call to Action Button</Button></Card.CTA>
  </Card.Root>
</Canvas>

<!--## External

Those elements are the ones that are **specific for a company or library**, and they are not part of the core of **UXDL**. The main idea is to bring the opportunity to create components from **SDKs** or **APIs** writing the code just once.

The first external component was `Mermaid`:

<Canvas>
  <Mermaid>
    <span>Click me</span>
  </Mermaid>
</Canvas>
