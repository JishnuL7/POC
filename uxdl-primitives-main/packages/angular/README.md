# UX Design Library (UXDL)

The UX Design Library is a central repository of flexible guidelines and 
code that can be easily adapted to help designers and developers quickly 
create trustworthy, accessible, and consistent experiences.

# Principles of UXDL

### Consistency

All components follow same design aesthetics and patterns and are in 
line with modern trends and P&G approved standards.

### Quality

We did our best to ensure high quality and usability of each component and
tested them on desktop, iOS and Android.

### Efficiency

Reusing components reduces design effort and speeds up the development work.
