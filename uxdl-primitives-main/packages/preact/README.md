# UX Design Library (UXDL)

The UX Design Library is a central repository of flexible guidelines and 
code that can be easily adapted to help designers and developers quickly 
create trustworthy, accessible, and consistent experiences.

# Principles of UXDL

### Consistency

All components follow same design aesthetics and patterns and are in 
line with modern trends and P&G approved standards.

A Component...

... should be written once but cross-compiled for different frameworks

... should have a minimum style for functionality and user experience while being easy to extend

... should provide a default theme for P&G (Corporate Theme) while able to customize for each business unit/use case

### Quality

We did our best to ensure high quality and usability of each component and
tested them on desktop, iOS and Android.

A Component ...

... should be accessible

... should be made for developers

... should be tree-shakeable

... should be compatiable with StoryBook

### Efficiency

Reusing components reduces design effort and speeds up the development work.

A Component ...

... should be easy to create new variants (themes)

... should be inspired by other UI Libraries

... should accelerate developers and product designers
